## Introduction
An interesting application of Monte Carlo methods is estimating the value of pi. By estimating the area of a unit circle and using the equation of the area of a circle, we can find pi. This is part of exercise 6.5 in the computational physics textbook by Landau (2015)[^1] on Monte Carlo integration.
